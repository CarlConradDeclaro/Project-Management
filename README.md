Project management is the practice of organizing and guiding a team to complete a specific set of tasks to achieve a desired outcome. It involves a structured approach to achieve success within predefined constraints, typically time, budget, and resources.

Think of it as a roadmap for your project, ensuring everyone involved stays on track and the project delivers the intended results.
